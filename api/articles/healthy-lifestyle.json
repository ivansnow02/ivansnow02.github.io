{"title":"Why Students Should Be Encouraged To Lead A Healthy Lifestyle","uid":"b7a12f40793785dcf055c9f5d18701da","slug":"healthy-lifestyle","date":"2023-06-08T01:21:01.000Z","updated":"2024-03-16T09:37:55.959Z","comments":true,"path":"api/articles/healthy-lifestyle.json","keywords":"Code, Learning, Backend, Frontend","cover":null,"content":"<p>According to the World Health Organization, more than 80% of the world’s adolescents are insufficiently physically active. This alarming statistic shows that many students neglect their health in pursuit of academic excellence or other goals. However, health is not something that can be sacrificed or ignored. I believe that students should be encouraged to lead a healthy lifestyle by schools, families and society. While the physical benefits of doing so are widely recognized, I want to emphasize its positive effects on our mental health.</p>\n<p>Health is the foundation of happiness. By engaging in regular exercise, eating a balanced diet, and getting sufficient sleep, one can not only prevent illnesses and boost the immune system, but also lower stress levels and anxiety. Moreover, a healthy lifestyle can enhance students’ academic performance, which is of utmost importance for us students. For instance, I used to sleep only 5 hours a day and rarely exercise when I was in high school.  Soon I suffered from a severe headache and lost concentration on my studies. As a result, my grades plummeted and this in turn made me more anxious and even harder to fall asleep. One day I decided to change the unhealthy lifestyle. I started to go to bed earlier and keep jogging. It really worked! I felt more energetic and confident than ever before.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, leading a healthy lifestyle is not only beneficial for students’ physical health, but also for their mental well-being and academic performance. As far as I am concerned, at no time should we underestimate the benefits of leading a healthy lifestyle.</p>\n","text":"According to the World Health Organization, more than 80% of the world’s adolesc...","permalink":"/post/healthy-lifestyle","photos":[],"count_time":{"symbolsCount":"1.6k","symbolsTime":"1 mins."},"categories":[{"name":"English","slug":"English","count":4,"path":"api/categories/English.json"}],"tags":[{"name":"English","slug":"English","count":4,"path":"api/tags/English.json"}],"toc":"","author":{"name":"Ivan Snow","slug":"blog-author","avatar":"https://ivansnow02.github.io/img/avatar.png","link":"/","description":"目前就读于某大学的计算机科学与技术专业，在学习后端与CV中","socials":{"github":"https://github.com/ivansnow02","twitter":"","stackoverflow":"","wechat":"","qq":"","weibo":"","zhihu":"","csdn":"","juejin":"","customs":{}}},"mapped":true,"hidden":false,"prev_post":{"title":"The Power of Robert Capa's The Falling Soldier","uid":"76e09a24f065289061dc76386548c213","slug":"TheFallingSoldier","date":"2023-06-10T12:43:08.000Z","updated":"2024-03-17T05:24:32.128Z","comments":true,"path":"api/articles/TheFallingSoldier.json","keywords":"Code, Learning, Backend, Frontend","cover":"/img/the_falling_soldier.jpg","text":"Today, I would like to talk about one of the most famous and controversial war p...","permalink":"/post/TheFallingSoldier","photos":[],"count_time":{"symbolsCount":"2.1k","symbolsTime":"2 mins."},"categories":[{"name":"English","slug":"English","count":4,"path":"api/categories/English.json"}],"tags":[{"name":"English","slug":"English","count":4,"path":"api/tags/English.json"}],"author":{"name":"Ivan Snow","slug":"blog-author","avatar":"https://ivansnow02.github.io/img/avatar.png","link":"/","description":"目前就读于某大学的计算机科学与技术专业，在学习后端与CV中","socials":{"github":"https://github.com/ivansnow02","twitter":"","stackoverflow":"","wechat":"","qq":"","weibo":"","zhihu":"","csdn":"","juejin":"","customs":{}}}},"next_post":{"title":"物理复习","uid":"aaaba9efa9b11264d3d9cfa935b26602","slug":"物理复习","date":"2023-06-07T09:36:59.000Z","updated":"2024-03-17T09:32:00.110Z","comments":true,"path":"api/articles/物理复习.json","keywords":"Code, Learning, Backend, Frontend","cover":"/img/physics.jpg","text":" 运动和力 角加速度: β=dωdt=d2θdt2\\beta = \\frac{d \\omega}{d t}=\\frac{d^2 \\theta}{d t^2}β=...","permalink":"/post/物理复习","photos":[],"count_time":{"symbolsCount":"17k","symbolsTime":"16 mins."},"categories":[{"name":"Physics","slug":"Physics","count":1,"path":"api/categories/Physics.json"}],"tags":[{"name":"learning","slug":"learning","count":8,"path":"api/tags/learning.json"},{"name":"Physics","slug":"Physics","count":1,"path":"api/tags/Physics.json"}],"author":{"name":"Ivan Snow","slug":"blog-author","avatar":"https://ivansnow02.github.io/img/avatar.png","link":"/","description":"目前就读于某大学的计算机科学与技术专业，在学习后端与CV中","socials":{"github":"https://github.com/ivansnow02","twitter":"","stackoverflow":"","wechat":"","qq":"","weibo":"","zhihu":"","csdn":"","juejin":"","customs":{}}}}}
