However, making friends can be daunting for some students, especially when seeking meaningful connections. Fortunately, there are some effective strategies that you can use to make friends.</p>\n<p>The first step is <strong>to be open and approachable</strong>. For example, a simple smile can break the ice between strangers. A friendly attitude creates a comfortable atmosphere and makes others feel welcomed. By being approachable, you signal to others that you are open to conversations and building connections.</p>\n<p><strong>Participating actively in extracurricular activities and clubs</strong> is another proven way of making friends that enriches your academic and social life. By engaging in shared interests, you will bond with like-minded people and nurture new friendships.</p>\n<p>It’s important to remember that <em>a friend without faults will never be found</em>. <strong>Try to be patient and tolerant of diversity among people</strong>. Do not judge people based on appearance, background, or opinions. Try to learn from others and respect differences.</p>\n<p><em>Be slow in choosing a friend</em>. Building meaningful connections requires <strong>patience and persistence</strong>. Do not be discouraged if friendships do not form immediately. Continue putting yourself in social situations and engaging with others.</p>\n<p><em>The only way to have a friend is to be one</em>. I believe the best way for students to make friends is to become their best selves. Therefore, by following these strategies, you will not only form lasting bonds and relationships, but also form a whole new self.</p>\n","text":"Friendship is an essential aspect of a student’s life that fosters personal grow...","permalink":"/post/making-friends","photos":[],"count_time":{"symbolsCount":"1.6k","symbolsTime":"1 mins."},"categories":[{"name":"English","slug":"English","count":4,"path":"api/categories/English.json"}],"tags":[{"name":"English","slug":"English","count":4,"path":"api/tags/English.json"}],"toc":"","author":{"name":"Ivan Snow","slug":"blog-author","avatar":"https://ivansnow02.github.io/img/avatar.png","link":"/","description":"目前就读于某大学的计算机科学与技术专业，在学习后端与CV中","socials":{"github":"https://github.com/ivansnow02","twitter":"","stackoverflow":"","wechat":"","qq":"","weibo":"","zhihu":"","csdn":"","juejin":"","customs":{}}},"mapped":true,"hidden":false,"prev_post":{"title":"Redis的快速入门","uid":"0437c0ef9a3f376d408b0ef08ee77a3d","slug":"Redis-Learning-02-快速入门","date":"2023-05-08T12:16:45.000Z","updated":"2024-03-18T09:11:08.367Z","comments":true,"path":"api/articles/Redis-Learning-02-快速入门.json","keywords":"Code, Learning, Backend, Frontend","cover":"/img/redis.jpg","text":" Redis命令行客户端 Redis安装完成后就自带了命令行客户端：redis-cli，使用方式如下： 1redis-cli [options] [common...","permalink":"/post/Redis-Learning-02-快速入门","photos":[],"count_time":{"symbolsCount":"3.3k","symbolsTime":"3 mins."},"categories":[{"name":"Redis","slug":"Redis","count":4,"path":"api/categories/Redis.json"}],"tags":[{"name":"coding","slug":"coding","count":19,"path":"api/tags/coding.json"},{"name":"Redis","slug":"Redis","count":4,"path":"api/tags/Redis.json"}],"author":{"name":"Ivan Snow","slug":"blog-author","avatar":"https://ivansnow02.github.io/img/avatar.png","link":"/","description":"目前就读于某大学的计算机科学与技术专业，在学习后端与CV中","socials":{"github":"https://github.com/ivansnow02","twitter":"","stackoverflow":"","wechat":"","qq":"","weibo":"","zhihu":"","csdn":"","juejin":"","customs":{}}}},"next_post":{"title":"离散数学复习","uid":"6690aa0e5bbdd795f0a15fde119a77e1","slug":"离散数学","date":"2023-04-24T12:11:05.000Z","updated":"2024-05-08T02:26:21.148Z","comments":true,"path":"api/articles/离散数学.json","keywords":"Code, Learning, Backend, Frontend","cover":"/img/maths.jpg","text":" 集合论 集合的基本概念 集合的定义 具有某种特定性质事物的全体，通常，用大写的英文字母A,B,C,……A, B, C,……A,B,C,……表示集合 集合的元素...","permalink":"/post/离散数学","photos":[],"count_time":{"symbolsCount":"43k","symbolsTime":"39 mins."},"categories":[{"name":"Math","slug":"Math","count":2,"path":"api/categories/Math.json"}],"tags":[{"name":"learning","slug":"learning","count":9,"path":"api/tags/learning.json"},{"name":"Math","slug":"Math","count":2,"path":"api/tags/Math.json"},{"name":"Discrete Mathematics","slug":"Discrete-Mathematics","count":1,"path":"api/tags/Discrete-Mathematics.json"}],"author":{"name":"Ivan Snow","slug":"blog-author","avatar":"https://ivansnow02.github.io/img/avatar.png","link":"/","description":"目前就读于某大学的计算机科学与技术专业，在学习后端与CV中","socials":{"github":"https://github.com/ivansnow02","twitter":"","stackoverflow":"","wechat":"","qq":"","weibo":"","zhihu":"","csdn":"","juejin":"","customs":{}}}}}
